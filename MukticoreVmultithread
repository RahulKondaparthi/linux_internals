Multicore refers to a computer or processor that has more than one logical CPU core, and that can physically execute multiple instructions at the same time. 
A computer's "core count" is the total number of cores the computer has: computers may have multiple processors, each of which might have multiple cores; 
the core count is the total number of cores on all of the processors.



Multithreading refers to a program that can take advantage of a multicore computer by running on more than one core at the same time. 
In general, twice as many cores equals twice as much computing power (for programs that support multithreading) though some problems are limited by factors other than CPU usage;
these problems will not experience gains that are as dramatic from multithreading.

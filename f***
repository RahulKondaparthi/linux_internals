op = -126
Here a variable a holds the value 130 of integer datatypes, which is then type casted to char datatypes using pointer variable. 
As we know that a value 130 is exceeding the char range( -128 to 127), thus it loops through its range.

For Example
128 = -128
129 = -127
130 = -126
140 = -125

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
	int i = 3;
	int *j;
	int **k;
	j = &i;
	k = &j;
	k++;
	printf("%d ",**k);
	return 0;
}
op": runtime error or   compilation succes with some reg value 102837980
Here k is the pointer variable which holds the address of another pointer variable j. where j is also a pointer variable which also holds the address of another variable i. 
Now when the address of a pointer variable k is incremented by 1 , then k hold some other garbage value which is not the address of any other variable. Thus runtime error occurs.

Parameters	                                           Semaphore	                                                                              Mutex
Mechanism	                              It is a type of signaling mechanism.	                                               It is a locking mechanism.
Data Type	                              Semaphore is an integer variable.	                                                   Mutex is just an object.
Modification	                    The wait and signal operations can modify a semaphore. 	               It is modified only by the process that may request or release a resource.
Resource management	          If no resource is free, then the process requires a
                                          resource that should execute wait operation. 
                                It should wait until the count of the semaphore is greater than 0.	           If it is locked, the process has to wait. The process should be kept in a queue. 
                                                                                                                                 This needs to be accessed only when the mutex is unlocked.


 Types	                          Types of Semaphore are counting semaphore and binary semaphore.	                              Mutex has no subtypes.
Operation	S                       emaphore value is modified using wait () and signal () operation.	                            Mutex object is locked or unlocked.
Resources Occupancy	                 It is occupied if all resources are being used and the process 
                                     requesting for resource performs wait () operation and blocks 
                                     itself until semaphore count becomes >1.	                                                  In case if the object is already locked,
                                                                                                                                  the process requesting resources waits and 
                                                                                                                                   is queued by the system before lock is released.

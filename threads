Threads:
            A thread is a lightweight process and forms the basic unit of CPU utilization. 
            A process can perform more than one task at the same time by including multiple threads.

            A thread has its own program counter, register set, and stack
            A thread shares resources with other threads of the same process the code section, the data section, files and signals.

pthread_t pthread_self(); to know present process pid

pthread_t pthread_exit(); to terminate the thread

ex:
void *my_thread()
{
printf("rahul");
return  null;
}
int main()
{
pthread_t tid;

pthread_create(&tid,NULL,my_thread,NULL);
pthread_join(tid,NULL);
exit(0);

}

Deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource
and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process.

Mutual Exclusion: One or more than one resource are non-sharable (Only one process can use at a time)
Hold and Wait: A process is holding at least one resource and waiting for resources.
No Preemption: A resource cannot be taken from a process unless the process releases the resource.
Circular Wait: A set of processes are waiting for each other in circular form.

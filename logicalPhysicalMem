PARAMENTER	                    LOGICAL ADDRESS	                            PHYSICAL ADDRESS
Basic	                     generated by CPU	                                    location in a memory unit
Address Space	            Logical Address Space is set of all                    Physical Address is set of all physical
                         logical addresses generated by CPU                     addresses mapped to the corresponding logical addresses
                          in reference to a program.	
                          
                          
Visibility	             User can view the logical address of a program.	      User can never view physical address of program.

Generation	               generated by the CPU	                                  Computed by MMU0


Access	                The user can use the logical address to                  The user can indirectly access physical address
                          access the physical address.	                             but not directly.

Why Semophers than message queues.
---------------------------------
Message queues is that we can send only 1024bytes of data.But in shared memory we can use more that depends on the physical memory of the sys.


1)two urelated process can access the same logical memory.

 very effievient way to communicate bw two process
 
 it is a special range of address psace created by IPC and apperas in the address spcae pf process,So, Other process can "attach" the same memeory to their own address pscae.
 
 2)if one process writes into the memory it will be visible to all the process.
 
 #include<shm.h> --library.
 
 CREATE SHARED MEMORY:
 ====================
 using shared memoryget we can create th
# int shmget(key_t key, size_t size, int shm_flag);

ACCESS SHAREDMEM:
=================
using attach fucntion to access


# void *shmat(int shm_id, const void *shm_addr, int shm_flag);

DETATTACH:
=========
int shmdt(const void *shm_addr);

DISADVANTAGE:
+++++++++++++
No sychronized acees programmer need to synchronize access

A socket is communication mechanism that allows cliient/server systms either locally or single machine or across networks.
ex:web pages,http,ftp generally use sockets.

------->A server application creates a socket.Whcih like a File descriptor is a resource assigned server process and that process alone.

server side API;s:

Creating A Socket:
=================
           int socket(int domain,int type,int protocol);
          
           domain is a medium generally all linux m/c will use AF_INET( Internet networking);
           Protocol:streams and datagrams
                    stream socket:  provide a connection that is a sequenced and reliable two-way byte stream
                    datagram socket: A datagram socket, specified by the type SOCK_DGRAM, doesnâ€™t establish and maintain a connection. 
                                     There is also a limit on the size of a datagram that can be sent
           return file descriptor;
Naming a socket:
===============
To make socket availble to other procees to use will give a name.A server prog wiil give a name to socket.
          int bind(int socket,const sockaddr *address,size_t add_len);
          
Server listen mode:
===================
           int listen(int socket, int backlog);
           a 5 very common backlog.
Accepting Connections:
=====================
Once a server program has created and named a socket, it can wait for connections to be made to the socket by using the accept system call.
          
           int accept(int socket,struct sockaddr *address,size_t add_len);
===========================================================================================================================================
Client side API's

Requesting Connections:
======================
Client programs connect to servers by establishing a connection between an unnamed socket and the server listen socket. They do this by calling connect.
           int connect(int socket,const sockaddr *address,size_t add_len);
Closing A socket:
=================
         int close(int sock);
=================================================================================================================================================================
